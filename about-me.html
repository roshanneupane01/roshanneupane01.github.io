      <p>
        As a full-stack Software Engineer, I build innovative software solutions
        using front-end and back-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        TypeScript, Java, SpringBoot, SQL, Git, and GitHub as my main tools. I
        enjoy finding logic and solving problems in creating robust software
        that meets the client's needs and expectations.
      </p>

      <p>
        I graduated from the University of Texas at Arlington with a BS in
        Information Systems in December 2021, where I gained knowledge of
        front-end and back-end development technologies, such as HTML, CSS, UML,
        and Java. I also completed an Associate of Science degree in Information
        Systems from Dallas College North Lake Campus in 2020.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm a hard-working and goal-driven individual, constantly striving to
        broaden my knowledge and skills in software development. I have a strong
        work ethic and the ability to thrive in a team-based or individual work
        environment. My motivation is to create software that makes a positive
        impact on users and society.
